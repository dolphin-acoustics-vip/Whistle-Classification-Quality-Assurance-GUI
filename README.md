# Whistle-Classification-Quality-Assurance-GUI
This repository contains code implementing a simple graphical user interface (GUI) which biologists can use as an aid for quality assurance when selecting whistles. A user can have a machine learning model analyse wav files (specified by selection tables) to provide the user with a second opinion about their whistle selections.
